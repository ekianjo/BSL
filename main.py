#flow
#general idea is to reduce the workload associated with adding games from different sources

#bash script to install key components (wine, playonlinux, emulators,innoextract via associated PPAs)
#find appid automatically from Steam installs in POL
#appid finder to get steam grid image as well as game name from Steam
#create shortcuts automatically for POL games using the info from appid finder
#create shortcuts automatically for Emulator games and add proper controls
#confirm if steam controller is working as expected for all emulators
#GOG games installer -> create shortcut automatically as well
